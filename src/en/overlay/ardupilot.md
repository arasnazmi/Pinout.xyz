# ArduPilot header connections

These connections are the 40-pin header functions assigned by the official T3 Gemstone ArduPilot configuration after the required device-tree overlays are enabled.

## Navigation and control

* **GPS and external compass:** pins 7 (UART-MAIN6 RX), 11 (UART-MAIN6 TX), 3 (I2C-MCU0 SDA) and 5 (I2C-MCU0 SCL).
* **RC input:** pin 10 (UART-MAIN1 RX) accepts SBUS.
* **RC outputs:** pins 29, 8, 31, 33, 32, 36 and 12 provide RCOut 1 through RCOut 7 respectively.
* **Telemetry:** pins 18 (UART-WKUP0 TX) and 26 (UART-WKUP0 RX).

## Other assigned pins

Pins 19, 21, 23 and 24 form SPI-MCU0. Pins 27 and 28 are reserved I2C-WKUP0 lines, while pin 37 is assigned to the external buzzer.

> **SBUS warning:** SBUS uses an inverted serial signal. An external signal inverter is required between the receiver and pin 10; do not connect a standard SBUS output directly.

> **Power and logic warning:** RCOut pins carry 3.3 V PWM logic only; they do not power a servo. Power servos and other loads from a correctly rated external supply with a shared ground, and use a driver or level shifter when required. Verify that GPS and telemetry signal levels are 3.3 V before connection.

Enable every overlay listed in the official ArduPilot guide before wiring peripherals. The guide also documents Linux device paths, service setup and QGroundControl connectivity.
